### Round 2 
![[../images/Inferno 9-13 Review 1.png]]
This is what out setup looked like at 20 secs left. We sat here since 1:00
- For extra context I have the only rifle for this round 
- Improvements to be made
	- Could try to reclaim map control as we had no idea where they were for the time we were in this setup. Could send one top mid to check and get info
	- Also the setup is just straight bad
		- I should be where alex is
		- Ari is okay but this isn't his site
		- Alex should be closer to apts to help crossfire with ari 
- overall movement was okay, need to pick a better setup 


### Round 5
![[../images/Inferno 9-13 Review 2.png]]

- Aaron got "chased" back to site 
- Alex gets picked by apts and lane 
- After alex dies aaron makes his way to the right side of boost and gets overwhelmed 
- I am there too but get blinded and fall back
- try and take top mid but get pushed by a guy moto 
- Here, I think Aaron and Alex need to get in better positions to crossfire the enemies
- I can also help out and throw some support util to counter them walking into site 

### Round 7
![[../images/Inferno 9-13 Review 3.png]]

- 2 T's rushed up mid prior to this
	- I get 1 and aaron gets the other. I get traded and we are in the above scenario with 1 minute left on the clock 
- I think milan rotated early but it is not a problem. Should rotate back with info from Aaron and Alex 
- Aaron is tucked porch, so I would like to see alex coming closer to support
	- Does get picked by the top mid guy 
- After aaron dies milan commits and goes A while the rest group up and hit B 

### Round 8 
- They rushed arches and I managed to fall back to CT and relay info
- Aaron and Alex were ready and got three before dying. we managed to retake with a 3v1 advantage

### Round 9

![[../images/Inferno 9-13 Review 4.png]]
- We won this round
- This is before they do their A wrap
	- Alex hides in ninja corner and hard looks for a motto push
	- I have probably commed that they are rushing arches. 
- Aaron gets the first guy that jumps apts and gets traded
- I kill 2 of the arch players and die
- Alex gets the bomb planter and then ari and milan clean up the round 

Main complaint is alex's positioning although not inherently bad. 

### Round 10

Round played out pretty good.
- T's rushed B, Ari and Milan get 2
- Alex peeked mid and died from awper 
- Ari dies buy a lurk
- They Go A and me and aaron are in the right positions to trade and kill them

Can't remember if there was a comm regarding if B was being hit or if it was paused 
Will advise against peeking mid, try to get apts control or keep top mid control. 

### Round 12

- Milan gets opening
- I die from top mid
	-  They blew open smoke and it caught me off guard smh
	- Either expect it or be not peeking. Site setup was passive compared to me
- Alex gets two pushing A and then aaron  and ari get the other two 




## T Side

### Round 13
- Bad ct smoke :( 
- Also threw the flashes way too early 

### Round 15 
- We were pretty disconnected
- Need to do a better job of being in a pack/being tradeable 
- Won round based off a CT flank 

### Round 17
- Started off with a man disadvantage
- Ari died from a guy playing car after the molly expired 
	- Alex was there but idk what he was watching (he was on top of logs I think)
- When taking banana, both people need to be able to trade each other 
- We got picks and re grouped to go back towards B 
- 2v2 postplant and Aaron tags a guy down to 1
- Alex kills the one but cannot transfer to the 2nd and we lose nt

### Round 18
- Alex went apts and got picked early
	- try going through bedroom if no molly and jiggle boiler 
- They push down mid while we are setting up for B
- We get one and then try to A (Milan pushes but me and Ari are up at the top of banana)
- We get the entry B and lose a post plant 


### Round 20
- Got opening picks and then split B
- Good trades, good spacing, good exeution on ideas

### Round 21

- Got top mid of a trade
- Alex gets picked across map.
- I call for a flash apts to try and get a pick but bad timing 
	- no bomb
	- no one else ready to go into the site


### Round 21

## Takeaways

Try different setups for A and pit 
This pug the opps did not hit B very frequently. but I would advise to mix up the banana takes.
Need a codeword to kill noise across map or to pause
Need a codeword also if an exec gets paused as well
