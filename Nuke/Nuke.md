## Structure


### CT Side

![[images/Nuke default setup.png]]
- One Outside (Ari)
	- Should play it differently 
	- Comming if tthey are able to come down ramp 
	- Have to make it uncomfortable for them if they are crossing or are outside 
- Two Upper (Milan and I)
	- Molly into hut 
	- Molly squeaky door
	- If squeaky is open we need to keep it smoked and be aware of the possibility of a lurk
	- Squeaky being not open only helps us  as CTS
		- I should use my smoke first 
- One Ramp (Alex)
	- Molly/Smoke Ramp at the beginning of the round
	- Will rotate down to B if pressured
	- Try to rotate silently 
- Rotate/Awp (Aaron)
	- Can start heaven, ramp or outside
	- Typically helping watch outside or ramp
	- Will typically pick up the spot that was left open 
	- 

#### Rotations 
Need to be willing to take space when one of us dies on the ct hold
For example if Ari dies outside, either Milan or Alex have to rotate down into B
If one of these rotates happen Aaron can pick up the piece of ramp or outside 

If we know there are alot of them outside, we can push into lobby. 
#### Setups

##### Outside
- Two Outside
	- One does the [[Nuke Nades/Glaive Smoke|Glaive Smoke]]
		- This guy pushes the smoke off the back of flashes
	- Second guy does flashes over top which should blind the outside people
	- There are 2 variations 
	- These people push outside 
- 1 deep garage one heaven
	- Garage deep in the back left corner watching mini
	- Heaven with an awp preferably watching for outside cross or outside period

##### Inner 
- Lobby Crunch
	- Two Trophy
	- Squeaky player blows up squeaky then mollies it deep as Hut gets pushes
	- A anchor pushes into lobby and tries to kill the squeak guy 
	- One guy Outside
- On top of silo insite
	- Have a mini guy watch squeaky or keep squeaky smoked 
	- Play contact 

##### Ramp
- Aggresive Ramp
	- Awper mollies trophy corner
	- Apwer pushes up and watches behind the molly
	- Rifler pushes up and gets more control 
- Ramp boost and another player baiting

### T Side

Goal is to try and get CTs to over rotate around
Until we learn executes and stuff, should place our focus on outside and getting control of secret. 

- 3 Outside
	- Aaron, Milan, Ari
- 2 inner
	- Carlos, Alex

If focusing inner and aaron has awp, can put aaron and milan outside. Ari go Inner
Otherwise, milan and ari outside. 

- Diagsmokes and Cross Smokes
