#### Setups

##### Outside
- Two Outside
	- One does the [[Nuke Nades/Glaive Smoke|Glaive Smoke]]
		- This guy pushes the smoke off the back of flashes
	- Second guy does flashes over top which should blind the outside people
	- There are 2 variations 
- 1 deep garage one heaven
	- Garage deep in the back left corner watching mini
	- Heaven with an awp preferably watching for outside cross or outside period
	
##### Inner 
- Lobby Crunch
	- Two Trophy
	- Squeaky player blows up squeaky then mollies it deep as Hut gets pushes
	- A anchor pushes into lobby and tries to kill the squeak guy 
	- One guy Outside
- On top of silo insite
	- Have a mini guy watch squeaky or keep squeaky smoked 
	- Play contact 

##### Ramp
- Aggresive Ramp
	- Awper mollies trophy corner
	- Apwer pushes up and watches behind the molly
	- Rifler pushes up and gets more control 
- Ramp boost and another player baiting 


### T Side

Goal is to try and get CTs to over rotate around
Until we learn executes and stuff, should place our focus on outside and getting control of secret. 

- 3 Outside
	- Aaron, Milan, Ari
- 2 inner
	- Carlos, Alex

If focusing inner and aaron has awp, can put aaron and milan outside. Ari go Inner
Otherwise, milan and ari outside. 

- Diagsmokes and Cross Smokes
