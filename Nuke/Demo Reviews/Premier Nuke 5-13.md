## CT Side

Omitted Rounds are pistoll
### Round 3
![[../images/Premier Nuke 5-13 1.png]]
- Pic Taken before first kill
	- Alex Kills First Guy and then Aaron is down and ready to support
	- Few Seconds of Fighting leads to Alex and then aaron dying
	- Main Note is having Alex playing closer to the boxes, especially bc in this round has an mp9 
	- Milan rotated down immediately --- good 
	- Aaron dies once milan gets to control
	- Left in a 4v3 retake.


### Round 4
![[../images/Premier Nuke 5-13 2.png]]
- Hard to see aaron pos but he starts heaven, goes down ladder and goes hell. 
- Ari dies after Aaron leaves the hell area (gets peeks while looking outside)
	- I think its better to jiggle outside, especially if Aaron is in a position where he can watch cross and comm
- Shortly after alex gets peeked and dies 
	- in scenarios where you see someone but aren't able to get an immediate kill (Especially with an smg) prob best to drop and relay info 
- Intended to save but got kills and made it an even 3v3. Aaron dies afterwards and probably should've still been a save and I look for a gun

### Round 7
![[../images/Premier Nuke 5-13 3.png]]

- This is like 10 seconds into the round 
- First T drops down vents
- Second guy throws molotov and then kills aaron
	- I trade and rotate to ramp to stop any potential lurks 
- As this happens Ari kills someone outside. 
- Alex rotates down to B and kills the first guy that went down (had bomb)
- Milan tries to rotate down and gets killed by the guy in lobby who was watching for rotates 
- Ari makes his way down secret and then we play bomb and win
- T's grouped up after the three deaths 
Rotates good, and reactions are good.  


### Round 8 
![[../images/Premier Nuke 5-13 4.png]]

- I die first (Miss my deep molly and whiff spray)
- Immediately afterwards a smoke is thrown mini and Aaron moves into site
	- Aaron dies by the squeaky guy
- Milan gets peeked behind smoke and dies 
- Ari kills one outside then gets traded 
- Alex tto save/die 
- I think if I die early like that and they throw upper utility, Aaron should play retake for A and try and support outside
- Ari
	- Hard to help with the mini 
### Round 10 
- Alex gets picked ramp early
- I die trying to push smoke to get ramp info (dumb)
- Milan and Aaron psuedo lineup 
- Ari dies outside 

### Round 11
- We are on eco
- We push lobby and kill 3
- Gets Dicey as I try to trade Aaron.
- Alex Clutches

### Round 12 
![[../images/Premier Nuke 5-13 5.png]]
- Ari is going secret at start of round, Aaron fills spot
- Aaron gets picked by awper on silo (awping)
- Milan dies after smoking mini and gets peeked by squeaky (also awping)
	- I think in scenarious where one dies outside 
	- Alex should try to leave ramp and comm if he can or not
		- In Instance where he cannot, we must make a push into inner or try to get a kill elsewhere
		- e.g. smoke squeaky, I push into hut and milan pivots to try and get a timing outside 
- I kill 2 trying to crush A then get traded 
- Round End by Post Plant 

## T Side 

### Round 15
![[../images/Premier Nuke 5-13 6.png]]
- Got crushed by an lobby crunch
- Alex out in the open with no cover
- Ari dies from one rushing
- Milan lasered by the red guy  (mp9 btw)
- Aaron trades one
- I kill one flanking and die from the other
- Aaron dies afterwards 


### Round 16
 Ramp rush
- We get the first two picks ramp and then decide to play it slow
- Aaron manages to sneak past a smoke hell and tries to get info
- Alex walks into an awper
- CT's reagress as Aaron is finding more info 
- Aaron wins a 1v3 clutch 

### Round 17 
Outside Smokes

- Threw bad Diag smokes :(
	- Died bc of it
- Alex gets pick
- Someone pushes ari and kills hmi
- Milan tries to trade and dies 
- Same with aaron



## Considerations
- I think that Alex needs to learn some of the spots on ramp where he can play well
- Milan can help spot outside early with Ari while squeaky is mollied and Aaron can reinforce A early. Does not have to drop
- Once things settle util wise, Aaron can support ramp or outside and Milan can jiggle squeaky
